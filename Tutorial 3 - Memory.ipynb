    "- It would be important to learn from past experience and improve the agentic framework - memory is key to that\n",
    "- You can add to the memory bank of your Agents pre-inference (by collecting from a pool of data prior to running the Agent), or during inference (add on in between running subtasks)\n",
    "\n",
    "- In general, for the various Memory classes, you use:\n",
    "    - `append(list_of_memories)`: append a list of memories to the memory bank\n",
    "    - `retrieve(task: str)`: retrieves top_k memories based on task \n",
    "    \n",
    "## Use Memory in Agents\n",
    "- Agent class takes `memory_bank` as a parameter during initialisation of an `Agent`\n",
    "- memory_bank: class Dict[Memory]. Stores multiple types of memory for use by the agent. Customise the Memory config within the Memory class."

      "> ReAct is a novel paradigm that effectively integrates reasoning and actions within language models to address a variety of language reasoning and decision-making tasks. Unlike traditional methods that rely on isolated reasoning, ReAct combines model actions with corresponding observations, creating a coherent stream of inputs that enhances the model’s ability to reason accurately. This approach is particularly beneficial for tasks that require interactive decision-making, such as question answering, fact verification, text games, and web navigation. ReAct demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, learning from as few as one to six in-context examples, and consistently outperforms baseline models that focus solely on reasoning or acting. By prompting language models to generate both verbal reasoning traces and actions in an interleaved manner, ReAct enables dynamic reasoning, allowing the model to create, maintain, and adjust high-level plans for action, thereby improving its performance across diverse domains.\n",
